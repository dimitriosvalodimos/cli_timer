# CLI Timer

### A very, very, veeeeryyyy basic command line timer that plays a "Ding" sound when the time is up.

#### small test code as a minimalistic entrypoint for later projects.

## Usage:

run: `timer.sh [time][s/m/h for seconds, minutes or hours]

## Example:

`timer.sh 30 m` would take 30 minutes to play the final sound-effect.
